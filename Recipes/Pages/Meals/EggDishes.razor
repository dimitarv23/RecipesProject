            Eggs are a STAPLE in our fridge. While they may be known as a breakfast star, 
            these easy egg recipes can be made any time of day. From skillets to burgers to pizza (yes, we said pizza), 
            a good egg always hits the spot.
        </p>

            Why do we love these little guys so much, you may ask?
            Eggs are a great source of protein, giving an added nutritious boost to your healthy breakfast
            or weeknight dinner. Plus, they're oh so quick to whip up when you don't have the time (or energy!)
            to cook up a heftier protein.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what are you waiting for? Grab some eggs and get cracking on these tasty recipes!
