            Pork can make a weeknight dinner feel like a true event, but the other white meat has so much more to offer than just pork chops.
            These variations, like Vietnamese braised pork belly and our best-ever chorizo, will spice up your holiday spreads and summer BBQs—whenever the mood for pork tenderloin, pulled pork, or roast pork loin strikes.
            We know that pork gets a bad rap for being tricky to cook, but we're here to bust that myth.

            Slow-cook your next pork roast, grill up some pork tenderloin (with plenty of chimichurri!), or even air-fry some pork chops.
            We love how much rich heartiness pork adds to a wide variety of dishes, like our green chili pork stew, homemade shoyu ramen, and tacos al pastor.

            We've rounded up all our favorite side dishes for pork no matter what flavor-direction you take, from classic mashed potatoes and Instant Pot applesauce to miso roasted carrots and beer braised cabbage.
